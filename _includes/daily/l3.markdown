Create your first open source project (at least, in this class).

Find your team members and make sure you are sitting together so that
you can work together.


The instructions for the activity are at [Browser Add-on Activity](https://github.com/joannakl/ossd_materials/blob/master/activities/browser_add-on_activity.md) repository.

You should keep a Slack live-log during this activity.
- Create a channel in the course workspace on Slack.
- Invite all group members to the channel.
- Invite your instructor to the channel.
- Log your progress as you complete different parts of the activity.
(But do not duplicate the answers that you are providing elsewhere.)
There should be regular entries in the log.
You should not be just summarizing what you did at the very end.

A sample live log is shown in the "sample-live-log" channel in Slack workspace for the class. You can also see [its transcript](https://cs.nyu.edu/~joannakl/ossd_s20/activities/sample_live_log.html).


Readings:
- MDN [Browser Extensions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions) documentation

Due by as soon as possible:

- If you did not complete the in-class activity, work with your team members to finish
it (up to and including Part 5). Keep a live-log to document that meeting
(continue in the same channel as you were working with in class.)


Due by the end of the week (Feb 9):
- make a blog post for this week addressing at least some of the following:
  - comment about your group work on the browser extension
  - describe your own contributions to your team's efforts of building
  your browser extension
  - describe the state of your browser extension project: what progress
  your team made, what problems you encountered, will you have a working
  product by the due date
  - comment on new things you learned (tools, features of tools that you were not familiar with, etc) or
  learned about yourself (skills you realized you have, team work preferences and style, etc.)

- Read the _Getting Started_ section of the MDN [Browser Extensions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions).


Due by the end of 2/11:

- __With your team members__, work on the code of your proposed browser extension
(make sure that this is a team work with all team members making contributions -
keep in mind that individual commits made to the repository are tagged with your
username so it is easy for us to identify who is working on what and when) <br>
Note: you may need to revise your original vision of what this extension will do. <br>
Keep a live-log of each session when the team meets to work together. <br>
Each team will present their extension in class on Feb. 12.
